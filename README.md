# README #
This is a practice README file for my first repository. Thanks for getting me started, Launch School!

Files are .rb and .txt files that cover the exercies in Launch School's prepatory phase.

As of 2016-02-10 I am applying for a scholarship between WWC and LS to take LS's web application courses (full-stack dev). Fingers crossed.
